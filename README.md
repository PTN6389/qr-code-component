## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned a little bit more about the difference between Flexbox and Grid display. I chose Flexbox for this challenge because it's a simple layout. I initially did not have the flex-direction set, but my footer was displaying in the same row as my main content, so I had to add the flex-direction: column, which fixed the issue.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on how to use CSS to display the layout of a page using Flexbox and Grid.

### Useful resources

I used ChatGPT to help me understand the concepts of centering the main content, and the differences between Flexbox and Grid.
